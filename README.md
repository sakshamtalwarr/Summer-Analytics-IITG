## Overview
This repository contains my solutions for the Summer Analytics 2025 course assignments. Each week’s assignments focus on different aspects of data analysis using Python, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, applied on various datasets.

Each week folder typically includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file with solutions and code.
- Dataset files (`.csv`, `.xlsx`, etc.) used for that week’s assignment.

## Key Skills Covered
- Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data aggregation and grouping
- Creating and modifying DataFrame columns and indices
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Basic statistics and insights extraction

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the relevant week folder.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Ensure the datasets are in the same folder as the notebook.
5. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab
